###Add video player to any post or page

###Unlimited Video Players

Add as many video players to your site as you like.  The Video Player lets you create video players and save them for when ever you are ready to use them.  Or you can place a video player in any post by using the shortcode [video_player url="http://your_video_url.mp4" poster="http://link_to_your_poster_image.jpg"].

###Shortcode settings
* [video_player id="%postId%"] replace %postId% with the id of a video player you created and saved.
* [video_player url="http://your_video_url.mp4"]
* [video_player url="http://your_video_url.mp4" poster="http://link_to_your_poster_image.jpg"]
* [video_player url="http://your_video_url.mp4" poster="http://link_to_your_poster_image.jpg" type="mp4"] use any format accepted by the html5 video tag.

###Under the hood
The video player is powered by html5 and Video.js.

###Responsive video player
The Video Player Ultimate displays a responsive player everytime.  Just place the Video Player Ultimate shortcode [video_player id="%postId%"] on your page and the plugin code will do the rest.

###Multiple video players on a page

You can place multiple video players on the same page.  The video player can be for different videos or the same videos.  Either way, the video players for each video will not conflict with each other.  This will allow you to make a gallery by simply placing your videos inside a table layout.

###Video player video format
You can play any kind of video in the video player that is accepted by the html5 video tag.

###Video player default format
The video player will default to mp4 if you do not specify a format for your video.  You can specify a format for you video by setting the type attribute in the video player shortcode.
